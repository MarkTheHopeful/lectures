Multiple SFINAE techniques are demonstrated next. They can be used to solve any SFINAE-related problem you want.
No need to use only `retval` to help with the error message.

We use SFINAE to "remove" some overloads from overload set.
It's useful when:
* We know that there may be better overloads, but it's impossible to tell based on the signature.
* We know that this overload may not work and would like to report that immediately.

In C++20 a strictly better alternative is concepts. Specifically, the `requires` keyword and constraints.
